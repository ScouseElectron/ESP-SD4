This is a project I made to control LED lighting from a Stream Deck using an ESP-01S

HTTP Setup Page, change SSID/PASSPHRASE select DHCP/Static and enter IP information.

Upload to a ESP-01S and connect to the AP to setup WiFi/IP details.

Use 1 switch to mirror the Stream Deck locally on GPIO 2
Output is PWM on GPIO3

Press once to turn off/on and press and hold to dim, release and hold again to dim in the other direction.
